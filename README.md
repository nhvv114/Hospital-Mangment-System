Hospital-Mangment-System:
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is made to facilitate the smooth and effective exchange of information while integrating all facets of patient care. This all-inclusive system consists of a number of modules that address different aspects of running a hospital, such as scheduling, patient registration, staff administration, invoicing, and inventory control. The relational database management system that the HMS uses to assure data dependability and integrity provide a strong back-end structure. The system streamlines administrative and clinical procedures and supports many departments, hence facilitating cross-functional communication. The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram highlights the foreign key relationships that form the foundation of the relational database architecture by illuminating the links between various entities, including patients, physicians, nurses, and support personnel. By enhancing data management, operational effectiveness, and user-friendly interfaces, the HMS seeks to improve healthcare delivery, which will eventually lead to better patient outcomes and higher levels of satisfaction for both patients and healthcare professionals.
